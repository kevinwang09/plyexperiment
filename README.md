# Introduction

The S4 object in Bioconductor is great for many things. But every now
and then, I have problems manipulating the column or the row data of a
S4 object. This package provides several `dplyr`-style functions to
manipulate the column data of a S4 object.

This is an experimental package that only receives occasional updates.

# Demo

Suppose we have a `SingleCellExperiment` object, and we want to add in
the cell-type information

``` r
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(plyexperiment)
library(dplyr)

set.seed(123)
y <- matrix(rnorm(2000), ncol=20)
sce <- SingleCellExperiment(list(counts=y))

cell_type = sample(LETTERS, ncol(y), replace=TRUE)

## Traditional indexing
sce$cell_type = cell_type

## plyexperiment syntax
sce = sce %>% mutate_col(cell_type)
```

The benefit of `plyexperiment` is similar to the benefits of `tidyverse`
syntax and benefits from chaining using the pipe operators. For example,
the filter function is useful in spliting the data based on information
in the `colData`.

``` r
sce %>% filter_col(cell_type == "A")
```

    ## class: SingleCellExperiment 
    ## dim: 100 1 
    ## metadata(0):
    ## assays(1): counts
    ## rownames: NULL
    ## rowData names(0):
    ## colnames: NULL
    ## colData names(1): cell_type
    ## reducedDimNames(0):
    ## spikeNames(0):
    ## altExpNames(0):

## Exporting `reducedDim` data

The `scater` package contains a lot of useful functions in manipulating
SingleCellExperiment objects. In particular, the `reducedDim` slot
typically stores dimensional reduced data matrices.

However, to customise the plots based on your own personal taste could
be a bit tougher. For example, if you want to overlay the expression of
a cell-type marker onto the tSNE plot.

``` r
library(scater)
```

    ## Loading required package: ggplot2

``` r
example_sce <- mockSCE()
example_sce <- logNormCounts(example_sce)
example_sce <- runTSNE(example_sce, scale_features=NULL)

plotTSNE(example_sce, colour_by = "Mutation_Status")
```

``` r
(tsne_tbl = example_sce %>% 
  export_reducedDim(type = "TSNE", 
                    feature = c("Gene_0001", "Gene_0002")))
```
