# Introduction

The S4 object in Bioconductor is great for many things. But every now
and then, I have problems manipulating the column or the row data of a
S4 object. This package provides several `dplyr`-style functions to
manipulate the column data of a S4 object.

# Acknowledgement

This package was forked over from
[`sa-lee/plyexperiment`](https://github.com/sa-lee/plyexperiment) and
the main functions were originally written by Davis McCarthy and Aaron
Lun.
